Please implement code to model the logic of the world. Please implement the code following the template. 
Only output the definition for ` transition_func `.
You must implement the ‘ transition_func ‘ function as the main function to be called by the environment. 
The code needs to be directly runnable on the inputs as (state, action) and return (new_state) in python.
Do not output examples usage. Do not create any new classes. 
Let’s think step by step.
