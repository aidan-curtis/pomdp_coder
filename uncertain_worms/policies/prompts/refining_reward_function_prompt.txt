You are a robot exploring its environment. 

{env_description}

Your goal is to model the logic of the world in python. 
You have tried it before and came up with one partially correct solution, but it is not perfect. 
They can model the logic for some experiences but failed for others. 
You need to improve your code to model the logic of the world for all the experiences.
The new code needs to be directly runnable on the (state, action, next_state) tuple and return the (reward, done) tuple in python as provided in the experiences.

Here is the partially correct solution you came up with for mission "get to the goal". 
It can model the logic for some experiences but failed for others. 
You need to improve your code to model the logic of the world for all the experiences.
The new code need to be directly runnable on the (state, action, next_state) tuple and return the (reward, done) tuple in python as provided in the experiences.

```
{code_api}

{code}
```

The given code cannot model the logic of the world for all the experiences.
Here are some experiences that the code has successfully modeled.

{correct_experience}

Here is an example of experiences that the code failed to model.

{incorrect_experience}

For this failed experience, do you know what is different between the true rewards and dones from the environment and the predictions from the code? 
Do you know why the environment behaves in this way? 
Do you know why the code behaves differently from the environment? 
Which part of the code causes the problem? How to fix it? Please improve your code to model the logic of the world for all the experiences, accordingly. 
Please implement the code following the template. 
You must implement the ‘ reward_func ‘ function as the main function to be called by the environment. 
The code needs to be directly runnable on the (state, action, next_state) tuple and return (reward, done) in python as provided in the experiences. 
Do not output examples. 
Do not define or change any classes.
Do not define or use any functions other than the ‘ transition_func ‘ function.
