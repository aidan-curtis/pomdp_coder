Here is the current episode history for the task that you are doing right now

{current_episode}

Output the next aciton in the form where you fill in <action-here> with the action that is best for reaching the goal and maximizing reward.
For example, your code will look like this:

```
next_action:int = 0
```

The action should be an integer with no additional code. Explan your reasoning in one sentence.
