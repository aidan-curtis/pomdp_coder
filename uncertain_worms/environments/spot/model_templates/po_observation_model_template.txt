    Represents the non-centered field of view of the agent.

    The observation represents the agent's relative view of the world. 

    The agent is NOT in the center of the observation grid.

    The width and height of the observation grid are called view size.

    The agent is ALWAYS at obs.image[view_size // 2, view_size - 1] in the observation `image`

    Your may make use of the state.get_field_of_view helper function.

    Args:
        state (SpotState): the next state of the environment
        action (int): the action taken
        empty_obs (SpotObservation): an empty observation that needs to be filled and returned
    Returns:
        obs (SpotObservation): observation of the agent
